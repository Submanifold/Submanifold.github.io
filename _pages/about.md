I am currently a postdoctoral researcher in the School of Mathematical Sciences at the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), supervised by [Prof. Renjie Chen](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~renjiec/) since July 2024. 
Prior to this, I received my Bachelor’s (2018) and Ph.D. (2024) degrees from the School of Software at Tsinghua University, where I worked with [Prof. Bin Wang](https://binwangthss.github.io/) and [Prof. Zuoqiang Shi](https://shizqi.github.io/).
I also hold a dual Bachelor’s degree from the Department of Mathematical Sciences at Tsinghua University.

My research focuses on computer graphics and geometry processing, with a dedication to applying mathematical tools to model the fascinating digital world.
